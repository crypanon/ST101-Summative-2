## Testing (5 marks)

Requirements for testing
* At least 5 good test cases are needed
* The test cases should be selected following the guidance discussed in the course
    * For example, useful partition and boundary cases should be used
    * Please also write a short comment to explain how each case is chosen (e.g. boundary case between xx and yy partition, smallest value, etc)
* "Automate" the tests with the use of an `assert` statement

Please state where you put your testing below:
* test.ipynb

## Assertion (5 marks)

Requirements for using assertion to check internal logic
* Check the "always" correct conditions, if the code written is correct 
* Ensure meaningful error messages are used with `assert`

Please state where you have put the assertion statement to check internal logic below:
* Can be found in image_part_a.ipynb, image_part_b.ipynb.

## Action points (5 marks)

Address all the action points from your feedback for problem set 5 that are relevant to the problem set 8. If your group members are from different problem set 5 groups, a union of all relevant action points should be addressed.

Please list all action points from your feedback for problem set 5 below
* Ensure instructions understood properly.
* Use more docstrings and explanation
